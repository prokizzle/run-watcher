Create a python3 textual TUI app that monitors active and recent runs for selected repos that can show status, logs, and test/build failures for repos scoped to an org. left pane should show repos we're watching with some kind of compact and minimal status for recent or active runs, and right pane can show run status or failures or full log. We also want to use search to be able to add repos to our left pane list to poll and monitor. This should be for github
